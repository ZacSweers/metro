        Please follow the instructions below.

        If you have a usage or debugging question, please use the [Q&A feature of the repo's Discussions section](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/discussions/new?category=q-a) instead of creating an issue.

        Provide a brief summary of the issue in the title above
        
        When submitting, please use conventional **markdown formatting** and **syntax highlighting** for readability.
        
        Issues with code blocks that do not use syntax highlighting are less likely to be prioritized.

        Provide a [minimal, self-contained example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example) that reproduces the issue.
        
        Ideally, fork this repo and create a test case in integration or compiler unit tests that reproduces this and then link that here.
        
        A minimally reproducible project is also good, either as a link or attached here.
        
        If you cannot supply a repro case, it may be difficult or impossible to help. In this event, be as detailed as you can.
        
        Please include any relevant stack traces as you can (formatted as code blocks).
