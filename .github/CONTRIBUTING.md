# Contributing to Metro

Metro welcomes contributions! Small contributions like documentation improvements, small obvious fixes, etc are always good and don't need prior discussion. I liberally leave TODO comments in code that don't quite meet the standard of an issue but are still things worth improving :). For larger functionality changes or features, please raise a discussion or issue first before starting work.

## Development

Local development with Metro is fairly straightforward. You should be able to clone the repo and open it in IntelliJ as a standard Gradle project.

There are a few primary subprojects to consider.

1. `:compiler` — Metro's compiler plugin implementation lives. This includes compiler-supported interop features too.
2. `:compiler-tests` — Compiler tests using JetBrains' official compiler testing infrastructure.
3. `:gradle-plugin` — Metro's companion Gradle plugin implementation. Mostly just an extension API and compiler plugin wiring with KGP.
    - This is also where incremental compilation integration tests live!
4. `:runtime` — Metro's core multiplatform runtime API. This is mostly annotations plus some small runtime APIs.
5. `:interop-dagger` — An ancillary set of JVM-only Dagger-specific runtime APIs for interop with Dagger.
6. `samples/` — A separate gradle project that contains several sample projects. This _includes_ the core artifacts as an included build. You can add this project in IntelliJ as another Gradle project to support developing both. There are also some integration tests in here.
  - `:integration-tests` — self-explanatory.
  - `:multi-module-test` — A multi-module integration test.

There is a useful `./metrow` helper CLI that can perform a few common commands across the various subprojects. Before submitting a PR, it is useful to run the following:

1. `./metrow regen` — This regenerates `.api` files and runs all code formatters.
2. `./metrow check` — This runs checks across all included Gradle projects (including samples and the Gradle plugin).

## Testing

Tests are spread across a few areas.

* `compiler-tests/` — New compiler tests using JetBrains' official compiler testing infrastructure. If possible, write new compiler tests in here! See [this PR](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/pull/128) for more details on how they work.
* `compiler/src/test/` — Core compiler tests. These should be focused primarily on _error_ testing but can also perform limited functional testing. Note that while many tests are here, new tests should ideally use `compiler-tests`.
* `gradle-plugin/src/functionalTest` — Integration gradle tests, primarily focused on exercising different incremental compilation scenarios.
* `samples/` — Some samples have tests! This is useful to assert that these samples work as expected.
    * `integration-tests/` — Integration tests. These should only be functional in nature and not test error cases (error cases won't compile!). Note that new integration tests should usually be written in `compiler-tests`. Some scenarios, such as multi-compilation tests across Gradle, may make more sense to write here.

## Compiler Plugin Design

The compiler plugin is implemented primarily in two parts.

### 1. FIR

The FIR frontend generates declarations, generates supertypes, and performs diagnostic checks for Metro types. _Any_ class or callable declaration generated by Metro should be done _here_ as this is required for them to be visible in Kotlin metadata later.

Generators go in the `dev.zacsweers.metro.compiler.fir.generators` package.

Checkers go in the `dev.zacsweers.metro.compiler.fir.checkers` package.

New checker contributions are generally welcome. New generators almost always warrant prior discussion first!

### 2. IR

The IR backend performs two main functions:

1. _Implements_ declarations generated in FIR. This includes generated graphs, factories, member injectors, etc.
2. Performs dependency graph construction and validation. This is primarily spread across `DependencyGraphTransformer`, `BindingGraph`, and `Binding`.

Most of this is implemented as _transformers_ in the `dev.zacsweers.metro.compiler.ir.transformers` package. Note that _all_ transformers are run from the `DependencyGraphTransformer`, which is the only _true_ `IrTransformer` of the bunch and just delegates out to the other transformers as needed.

Aggregation hint properties are also implemented in IR as a workaround to support incremental compilation. See `ContributionHintIrTransformer` for more details.

### `TypeKey` and `ContextualTypeKey`

`TypeKey` and `ContextualTypeKey` (and their FIR counterparts) deserve special mention. Most of the compiler's dependency graph analysis thinks in terms of these two types.

A `TypeKey` is the canonical representations of specific binding, composed of a _type_ and optional _qualifier_.

A `ContextualTypeKey` can be thought up as a `TypeKey` _with context_ of how it's used. This is useful for a few reasons:

* Allows Metro's compiler plugin to generate code accordingly for how the given `TypeKey` is used at runtime, for example wrapping in `Provider`, `Lazy`, etc.
* Allows dependency graph resolution to understand if the type is _deferrable_, which is useful in breaking dependency cycles.

## Misc Notes

* IR code should cache eagerly.
* FIR code should cache carefully (remember it runs in the IDE!).
* FIR code should be defensive. It may run continuously in the IDE and not all information may be available to the compiler as the user has written it. If you've ever written a custom lint check, your methodology should be similar.
* Inversely, IR code should be offensive. Assert expectations with clear error messages, report errors with useful error messages.
* FIR-generated declaration should use descriptive _keys_ to declarations that can be referenced later in FIR and IR (as `origins`). See `Keys.kt` for FIR declarations and `Origins.kt` for their IR analogs.
