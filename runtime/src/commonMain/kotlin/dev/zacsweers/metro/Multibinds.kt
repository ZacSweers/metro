/**
 * Annotates abstract graph members that declare multibindings.
 *
 * You can declare that a multibound set or map is bound by annotating an abstract graph member that
 * returns the set or map you want to declare with `@Multibinds`.
 *
 * You do not have to use `@Multibinds` for sets or maps that have at least one contribution, but
 * you do have to declare them if they may be empty. Empty multibindings are an _error_ by default,
 * you must set [allowEmpty] to true to allow empty multibindings.
 *
 * ```
 * @DependencyGraph interface MyGraph {
 *   @Multibinds(allowEmpty = true) fun aSet(): Set<Foo>
 *   @Multibinds(allowEmpty = true) @MyQualifier val aQualifiedSet: Set<Foo>
 *   @Multibinds(allowEmpty = true) fun aMap(): Map<String, Foo>
 *   @Multibinds(allowEmpty = true) @MyQualifier val aQualifiedMap: Map<String, Foo>
 *
 *   @Provides
 *   fun usesMultibindings(set: Set<Foo>, @MyQualifier map: Map<String, Foo>): Any {
 *     return â€¦
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A given set or map multibinding can be declared any number of times without error. Metro
 * implements these declarations to return the declared multibinding.
