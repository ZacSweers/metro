 *
 * **Constraints**
 * - All containers must be instances (or objects) of _binding containers_.
 * - All containers must be non-local, canonical classes. i.e., they must be something with a name!
 * - This overload may be called in a member function body, top-level function body, or property
 *   initializer.
 * - The target [T] graph _must_ be annotated with [@DependencyGraph][DependencyGraph] and must be a
 *   valid graph on its own.
