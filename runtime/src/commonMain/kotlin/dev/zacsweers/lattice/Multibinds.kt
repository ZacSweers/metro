/**
 * Annotates abstract module methods that declare multibindings.
 *
 * You can declare that a multibound set or map is bound by annotating an abstract module method
 * that returns the set or map you want to declare with `@Multibinds`.
 *
 * You do not have to use `@Multibinds` for sets or maps that have at least one contribution, but
 * you do have to declare them if they may be empty.
 *
 * ```
 * @DependencyGraph interface MyGraph {
 *   @Multibinds aSet(): Set<Foo>
 *   @Multibinds @MyQualifier aQualifiedSet(): Set<Foo>
 *   @Multibinds aMap(): Map<String, Foo>
 *   @Multibinds @MyQualifier aQualifiedMap(): Map<String, Foo>
 *
 *   @Provides
 *   fun usesMultibindings(set: Set<Foo>, @MyQualifier map: Map<String, Foo>): Any {
 *     return â€¦
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A given set or map multibinding can be declared any number of times without error. Dagger never
 * implements or calls any `@Multibinds` methods.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://dagger.dev/multibindings">Multibindings</a>
