# Metro Project Status

## Last Updated: 2025-01-14

## Overall Status: **BETA**

Metro is functional and can be used in production with some limitations. The core dependency injection features are stable, but some advanced features are still experimental.

## Feature Status

### ‚úÖ Stable Features

- **Core DI**: Constructor injection, providers, scopes
- **Compile-time validation**: Full dependency graph validation at compile time
- **FIR+IR code generation**: Direct code generation into Kotlin compiler IR
- **Kotlin-inject API compatibility**: Top-level functions, native Lazy support
- **Anvil-style aggregation**: @ContributesTo, @ContributesBinding annotations
- **Multiplatform support**: Most major Kotlin multiplatform targets
- **IDE integration**: Error reporting in K2 IDE
- **Dagger interop**: Component-level interop with Dagger

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Features

- Performance optimizations for very large graphs

### üöß In Progress

- Enhanced IDE integration features
- Additional performance optimizations

## Recent Updates (2025-01-14)

### Implemented GPT5-Suggested Fixes

1. **@BindsInstance Parameter Handling**
   - Fixed instance field creation for @BindsInstance parameters
   - Ensured proper access to both instance and provider fields
   - Files: `IrGraphGenerator.kt`, `IrGraphExpressionGenerator.kt`

2. **Factory Invocation Fix**
   - Fixed MetroFactory.create() to properly invoke factories
   - Ensures instances are created, not just factory references
   - File: `IrMetroFactory.kt`

3. **SwitchingProvider Field Access**
   - Added special handling for field access from SwitchingProvider context
   - Routes field access through graph for dependencies
   - File: `IrGraphExpressionGenerator.kt`

4. **SwitchingProvider Recursion Prevention**
   - Ensured SwitchingProvider uses bypassProviderFor
   - Prevents infinite recursion in provider chains
   - File: `SwitchingProviderGenerator.kt`

### Test Results

| Test Suite | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Core DI Tests | ‚úÖ Passing | All basic DI functionality working |

## Known Issues

1. **Performance with Very Large Graphs**
   - Compilation time increases significantly with 1000+ bindings
   - Workaround: Use appropriate compilation settings

2. **Native Multiplatform Contributions**
   - Cannot contribute dependencies from native targets
   - Blocked by: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-75865
   - Workaround: Define native dependencies directly in graph

## Recommended Usage

### Production Ready ‚úÖ
- Standard dependency injection patterns
- Multiplatform projects (with noted limitations)
- Dagger migration/interop scenarios
- Projects with up to ~500 bindings

### Use with Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Very large projects (1000+ bindings)
- Native multiplatform with contributions

### Not Recommended ‚ùå
- Projects requiring 100% Dagger compatibility
- Scenarios requiring runtime dependency resolution

## Migration Guide

For projects migrating from Dagger:
1. Enable Dagger interop in Metro configuration
2. Start with a small component/module
3. Gradually migrate components using @Includes
