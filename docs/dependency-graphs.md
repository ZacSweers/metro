# Dependency Graphs

The primary entry points in Metro are *dependency graphs*. These are interfaces annotated with `@DependencyGraph` and created with `@DependencyGraph.Factory` interfaces. Graphs expose types from the object graph via accessor properties or functions.

!!! tip
    These are synonymous with *components* and `@Component`/`@Component.Factory` in Dagger and kotlin-inject.

!!! tip
    “Accessors” in Metro are synonymous with Dagger’s [provision methods](https://dagger.dev/api/latest/dagger/Component.html#provision-methods).

Accessors and member injections act as roots, from which the dependency graph is resolved. Dependencies can be provided via conventional `@Provides` functions in graphs or their supertypes, constructor-injected classes, or accessed from graph dependencies.

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph {
  val message: String

  @Provides
  fun provideMessage(): String = "Hello, world!"
}
```

*Note the `@Provides` function must define an explicit return type.*

Simple graphs like this can be created via the `createGraph()` intrinsic.

```kotlin
val graph = createGraph<AppGraph>()
```

Graphs are relatively cheap and should be used freely.

## Inputs

Runtime inputs can be provided via a `@DependencyGraph.Factory` interface that returns the target graph. These parameters must be annotated with exactly one of `@Provides`, `@Includes`, or `@Extends`.

### Provides

The simplest input is an instance parameter annotated with `@Provides`. This provides this instance as an available binding on the graph.

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph {
  val message: String

  @DependencyGraph.Factory
  fun interface Factory {
    fun create(@Provides message: String): AppGraph
  }
}
```

Provided parameters may be any type.

!!! tip
    This is analogous to Dagger's `@BindsInstance`.

### Includes

`@Includes`-annotated parameters are treated as containers of available bindings. Metro will treat _accessors_ of these types as usable dependencies.

They are commonly other graph types whose' dependencies you want to consume via explicit API.

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph {
  val message: String

  @DependencyGraph.Factory
  fun interface Factory {
    fun create(@Includes messageGraph: MessageGraph): AppGraph
  }

  @DependencyGraph interface MessageGraph {
    val message: String

    @Provides fun provideMessage(): String = "Hello, world!"
  }
}
```

`@Includes` instance dependencies do not _need_ to be other graphs though! They can be any regular class type. They _cannot_ be enums or annotation classes.

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph {
  val message: String

  @DependencyGraph.Factory
  fun interface Factory {
    fun create(@Includes messageProvider: MessageProvider): AppGraph
  }

  interface MessageProvider {
    val message: String
  }
}
```

!!! warning
    Includes parameters cannot be injected from the graph.

[Binding Containers](#binding-containers) are a special type of `@Includes` type, see more in its section below.

### Extends

`@Extends`-annotated parameters are for extending parent graphs. See _Graph Extensions_ at the bottom of this doc for more information.

### Creating factories

Graph factories can be created with the `createGraphFactory()` intrinsic.

```kotlin
val messageGraph =
  createGraphFactory<AppGraph.Factory>()
    .create("Hello, world!")
```

## Scoping

_See [Scopes](scopes.md) for more details on scopes!_

Graphs may declare a `scope` (and optionally `additionalScopes` if there are more). Each of these declared scopes act as an implicit `@SingleIn` representation of that scope for [aggregation](aggregation.md).

For example:
```kotlin
@DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
interface AppGraph
```

Is functionally equivalent to writing the below.

```kotlin
@SingleIn(AppScope::class)
@DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
interface AppGraph
```

## Graph Extensions

Dependency graphs can be marked as _extendable_ to allow child graphs to extend them. These are similar in functionality to Dagger's `Subcomponents` but are detached in nature like in kotlin-inject.

A graph must opt itself into extension in via `@DependencyGraph(..., isExtendable = true)`, which will make the Metro compiler generate extra metadata for downstream child graphs.

Then, a child graph can add an `@Extends`-annotated parameter to its creator to extend that graph.

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph(isExtendable = true)
interface AppGraph {
  @Provides fun provideHttpClient(): HttpClient { ... }
}

@DependencyGraph
interface UserGraph {
  @DependencyGraph.Factory
  fun interface Factory {
    fun create(@Extends appGraph: AppGraph): UserGraph
  }
}
```

Child graphs then contain a _superset_ of bindings they can inject, including both their bindings and their parents'. Graph extensions can be chained as well.

Child graphs also implicitly inherit their parents' _scopes_.

!!! tip "Hoisting unused scoped class injections in parent graphs"
    In some cases, there are scoped bindings that are unused in the parent graph but _are_ used in child graphs. Due to the detached nature of graph extensions, these bindings by default end up scoped to the child. To enforce that these bindings are scoped and held by the parent, Metro generates hints for these classes and discovers them during graph processing by default. You can disable this via the `enableScopedInjectClassHints` property in the Gradle DSL.
    
    See https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/issues/377 for more details.

### Contributed Graph Extensions

`@ContributesGraphExtension` is a specialized type of graph that is _contributed_ to some parent scope. Its generation is deferred until the parent graph interface is merged.

#### The Problem

Imagine this module dependency tree:

```
        :app
      /     \
     v       v
  :login   :user-data
```

`:app` defines the main dependency graph with `@DependencyGraph`. The `:login` module defines a graph extension for authenticated user flows, and `:user-data` provides some core functionality like `UserRepository`.

If `:login` defines its own graph directly with `@DependencyGraph`, it won't see contributions from `:user-data` _unless_ `:login` depends on it directly.

#### The Solution

Instead, `:login` can use `@ContributesGraphExtension(LoggedInScope::class)` + an associated `@ContributesGraphExtension.Factory(AppScope::class)` to say: "I want to contribute a new graph extension _to_ a future `AppScope` parent graph."

The graph extension will then be generated in `:app`, which already depends on both `:login` and `:user-data`. Now `UserRepository` can be injected in `LoggedInGraph`.

```kotlin
@ContributesGraphExtension(LoggedInScope::class)
interface LoggedInGraph {

  val userRepository: UserRepository

  @ContributesGraphExtension.Factory(AppScope::class)
  interface Factory {
    fun createLoggedInGraph(): LoggedInGraph
  }
}
```

In the `:app` module:

```
@DependencyGraph(AppScope::class, isExtendable = true)
interface AppGraph
```

The generated code will modify `AppGraph` to implement `LoggedInGraph.Factory` and implement `createLoggedInGraph()` using a generated final `$$ContributedLoggedInGraph` class that includes all contributed bindings, including `UserRepository` from `:user-data`.

```kotlin
interface AppGraph 
  // modifications generated during compile-time
  : LoggedInGraph.Factory {
  override fun createLoggedInGraph(): LoggedInGraph {
    return $$ContributedLoggedInGraph(this)
  }

  // Generated in IR
  @DependencyGraph(LoggedInScope::class)
  class LoggedInGraph$$MetroGraph(appGraph: AppGraph) : LoggedInGraph {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Finally, you can obtain a `LoggedInGraph` instance from `AppGraph` since it now implements `LoggedInGraph.Factory`:

```kotlin
// Using the asContribution() intrinsic
val loggedInGraph = appGraph.asContribution<LoggedInGraph.Factory>().createLoggedInGraph()

// Or if you have IDE support enabled
val loggedInGraph = appGraph.createLoggedInGraph()
```

#### Graph arguments

You can pass arguments to the graph via the factory:

```kotlin
@ContributesGraphExtension.Factory(AppScope::class)
interface Factory {
  fun create(@Provides userId: String): LoggedInGraph
}
```

This maps to:

```kotlin
// Generated in IR
@DependencyGraph(LoggedInScope::class)
class $$ContributedLoggedInGraph(
  @Extends parent: AppGraph,
  @Provides userId: String
): LoggedInGraph {
  // ...
}
```

In `AppGraph`, the generated factory method looks like:

```kotlin
// Generated in IR
override fun create(userId: String): LoggedInGraph {
  return LoggedInGraph$$MetroGraph(this, userId)
}
```

!!! warning
    Abstract factory classes cannot be used as graph contributions.

Contributed graphs may also be chained, but note that `@ContributesGraphExtension.isExtendable` must be true to do so!

## Binding Containers

Binding containers are classes or interfaces annotated with `@BindingContainer` that contain binding declarations (`@Provides` or `@Binds`) but are not themselves complete dependency graphs. They're analogous to Dagger's `@Module` annotation and can be used in cases where defining bindings in an (extended) interface is unwieldy or not helpful.

Unlike graphs and other `@Includes` types, their public accessors are _not_ read. Only `@Binds` and `@Provides` declarations are read.

!!! tip
    Binding containers can be seen as partial graphs and are intended to be reusable, composable units that are _included_ in a complete graph.

### Including via `@Includes` Parameters

The most flexible way to include binding containers is via `@Includes`-annotated parameters on graph factories.

```kotlin
@BindingContainer
class NetworkBindings(private val baseUrl: String) {
  @Provides fun provideHttpClient(): HttpClient = HttpClient(baseUrl)
}

@DependencyGraph
interface AppGraph {
  val httpClient: HttpClient

  @DependencyGraph.Factory
  interface Factory {
    fun create(@Includes networkBindings: NetworkBindings): AppGraph
  }
}
```

This allows you to bring any instance to the graph with its own internal logic.

### Including via `@DependencyGraph.bindingContainers`

For simple binding containers, you can declare them directly in the graph annotation:

```kotlin
@BindingContainer
object NetworkBindings {
  @Provides fun provideHttpClient(): HttpClient = HttpClient()
}

@DependencyGraph(bindingContainers = [NetworkBindings::class])
interface AppGraph {
  val httpClient: HttpClient
}
```

This method works for:
- `object` classes
- `interface` or `abstract class` types with only `@Binds` providers or companion object `@Provides` providers
- Simple classes with a public, no-arg constructor

### Chaining Binding Containers

Binding containers can include other binding containers using the `includes` parameter:

```kotlin
@BindingContainer
object CacheBindings {
  @Provides fun provideHttpCache(): Cache = Cache()
}

@BindingContainer(includes = [CacheBindings::class])
object NetworkBindings {
  @Provides fun provideHttpClient(cache: Cache): HttpClient = HttpClient(cache)
}

@DependencyGraph(bindingContainers = [NetworkBindings::class])
interface AppGraph {
  val httpClient: HttpClient
}
```

The transitive closure of all included binding containers will be included in the final consuming graph.

### Contributing Binding Containers

Binding containers can be contributed to scopes via `@ContributesTo`:

```kotlin
@ContributesTo(AppScope::class)
@BindingContainer
object NetworkBindings {
  @Provides fun provideHttpClient(): HttpClient = HttpClient()
}

@DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)
interface AppGraph {
  val httpClient: HttpClient
}
```

They can also replace other contributed binding containers:

```kotlin
// In a test variant
@ContributesTo(AppScope::class, replaces = [NetworkBindings::class])
@BindingContainer
object FakeNetworkBindings {
  @Provides fun provideFakeHttpClient(): HttpClient = FakeHttpClient()
}
```

Graphs may exclude contributed containers:

```kotlin
@DependencyGraph(AppScope::class, excludes = [NetworkBindings::class])
interface AppGraph {
  val httpClient: HttpClient
}
```

### Notes

- Companion objects, annotation classes, and enum classes/entries cannot be annotated with `@BindingContainer`
- Companion object providers within a binding container are automatically included
- Enclosing classes of `@Binds` or `@Provides` providers don't need to be annotated with `@BindingContainer` for Metro to process them - the annotation is primarily for reference to `@DependencyGraph.Factory` and the ability to use `includes`
- Binding containers may also be [contributed](aggregation.md#contributing-binding-containers).
- See [#172](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/issues/172) for more details.

## Implementation Notes

Dependency graph code gen is designed to largely match how Dagger components are generated.

* Internal graph validation uses [Tarjan's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm) + [topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) implementation.
  * This runs in O(V+E) time
  * The returned ordered list of bindings can be used to determine provider field generation order.
  * Any binding whose order depends on one later in the returned order implicitly requires use of `DelegateFactory`.
* Dependencies are traversed from public accessors and `inject()` functions.
* Metro generates Provider Factory classes for each provider. These should be generated at the same time that the provider is compiled so that their factory classes. This is for two primary purposes:
    * They can be reused to avoid code duplication
    * Metro can copy default values for provider values over to the generated factory to support optional bindings. Since default values may refer to private references, we must generate these factories as nested classes.
* Metro generates a graph *impl* class that holds all aggregated bindings and manages scoping.
* Scoped bindings are stored in provider fields backed by `DoubleCheck`.
* Reused unscoped providers instances are stored in reusable fields.
* `@Provides` factory parameters are stored in a field backed by `InstanceFactory`.
* Multibindings create new collection instances every time.
* Multibinding providers are not accessible as standalone bindings.
* Graph extensions are implemented via a combination of things
    * Custom `MetroMetadata` is generated and serialized into Kotlin's `Metadata` annotations.
    * Extendable parent graphs opt-in to generating this metadata. They write information about their available provider and instance fields, binds callable IDs, parent graphs, and provides callable IDs.
    * Extendable parent graphs generate `_metroAccessor`-suffixed `internal` functions that expose instance fields and provider fields.
    * Child graphs read this metadata and look up the relevant callable symbols, then incorporating these when building its own binding graph.
