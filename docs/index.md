# ðŸš‰ Metro

# Introduction

Metro is a compile-time dependency injection framework that draws heavy inspiration from [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger), [Anvil](https://github.com/square/anvil), and [Kotlin-Inject](https://github.com/evant/kotlin-inject). It seeks to unify their best features under one, cohesive solution while adding a few new features and benefits.

### Why another DI framework?

Itâ€™s felt for some time like the Kotlin community has been waiting for a library that unifies the best of Dagger, multiplatform, Anvil aggregation, compiler plugin, and Kotlin-first. Different solutions exist for parts of these, but thereâ€™s not yet been a cohesive, unified solution that checks all these boxes, leaves behind some of these toolsâ€™ limitations, and embraces newer features that native compiler plugins offer.

In short, Metro stands on the shoulders of giants. It doesnâ€™t seek to reinvent the wheel and tries to build on top of what existing solutions do well. The goal is a solution that unifies their best ideas.

!!! note
    _Iâ€™m aware of the [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/927/) ðŸ™‚, I think Metro offers a compelling feature set with interop hooks that make it easy to integrate with an existing codebase._

## Installation

Apply the gradle plugin.

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("dev.zacsweers.metro") version "x.y.z"
}
```

And that's it! The default configuration will add the multiplatform `runtime` artifact (which has annotations you can use) and wire it all automatically.

You can configure custom behaviors with APIs on the `metro` DSL extension.

```kotlin
metro {
  // Defines whether or not metro is enabled. Useful if you want to gate this behind a dynamic
  // build configuration.
  enabled = true // Default

  // Enable (extremely) verbose debug logging
  debug = false // Default
  
  // See the kdoc on MetroPluginExtension for full details
}
```

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snapshots].

## Supported platforms

The compiler plugin itself supports all multiplatform project types. The first-party annotations artifact is also
multiplatform and supports all common JVM, JS, and native targets.

## Caveats

- Kotlin compiler plugins are not a stable API! Compiled outputs from this plugin _should_ be stable,
  but usage in newer versions of kotlinc are not guaranteed to be stable.
- This is a prototype. See the issue tracker for incomplete/missing features.
