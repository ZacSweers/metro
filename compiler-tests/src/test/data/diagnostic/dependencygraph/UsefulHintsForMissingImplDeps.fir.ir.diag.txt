/module_main_UsefulHintsForMissingImplDeps.kt:(117,125): error: [Metro/MissingBinding] Cannot find an @Inject constructor or @Provides-annotated function/property for: FooImpl

    FooImpl is injected at
        [AppGraph] Bindings.bind: FooImpl
    Base is requested at
        [AppGraph] AppGraph.base

(Hint)
'FooImpl' doesn't appear to be visible to this compilation. This can happen when a binding references a type from an 'implementation' dependency that isn't exposed to the consuming graph's module.
Possible fixes:
- Mark the module containing 'FooImpl' as an 'api' dependency in the module that defines 'Bindings' (which is requesting it).
- Add the module containing 'FooImpl' as an explicit dependency to the module that defines 'AppGraph'.
