/AssistedTypesCannotBeProvidedWithoutQualifiers.kt:(262,266): error: [Metro/InvalidBinding] 'Taco' uses assisted injection and cannot be injected directly into 'test.ExampleGraph.exampleClass'. You must inject a corresponding @AssistedFactory type or provide a qualified instance on the graph instead.

(Hint)
It looks like the @AssistedFactory for 'Taco' may be 'Taco.Factory'.
